The following are the 4 use cases this project includes:

UC 1: Schedule a Photo Session: When the user selects the “Contact” button, they are redirected to the contact page. 
The contact page includes text fields for the user to fill out their name, email, type of session preference, 
date hoping to book, location and include details for the project, specifically, what is their vision. 
This information is saved into a database for Donavie to view easily 

UC 2: View Session Rates and FAQ: When the user selects the “Pricing and FAQ” button, they are redirected to the 
pricing and FAQ page. The user can view how much Donavie charges per session. Bellow the session rates is the FAQ section 
which includes answers for pre and post photo sessions which will help the user determine 
if they’d like to book a session with Donavie.

UC 3: View details about the photographer and testimonials: When the user selects the “About me” button, 
they are redirected to the about me page. The user can view a few fun facts about Donavie and why she’s a photographer. 
Further, the user can read testimonials from previous clients Donavie has worked with. 
This gives the user insight on Donavie’s skills as a photographer.

UC 4: View the photographer’s portfolio: When the user selects the “Portfolio” button, they are redirected to the portfolio page. 
The user can view slides of images from Donavie’s previous sessions and the projects she has done with small businesses.
