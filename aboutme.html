      <h4> <u> How I got into photography: </u> </h4>
      <ul>
        <p>
          Photography has been fascinating to me since middle school when I saw people at school and family members
          purchase
          their first DSLRs. The ability to capture any expression and hold the photo physically in your hand or view it
          digitally
          showed me how precious life is. Photographing memories brings me so much joy, as we can reminisce on those
          memories,
          may they be good or bad. In 2015, I took a photography course in high school. My cousin let me borrow his
          Canon Rebel T2i
          throughout the year. After I was done with the course, he let me keep it. I was so excited to capture memories
          with a
          quality camera. I would bring that camera to all my cross country meets to photograph my teammates racing. At
          family functions,
          I was the designated photographer, capturing family and food. Fast forward to 2018, I began to reach out to my
          friends to
          model for me for fun, or I'd ask them if they'd want to catch up and photoshoot. After doing that multiple
          times,
          I grew my love for portrait photography.

      <h4> <u> What I can do for you: </u> </h4>
      <ul>
        <p>
          For every photo session I hold, my wish for my client is that they are comfortable and be as authentic as
          possible when
          I take their photo. Creative shoots are a different story when I'm directing for a specific mood or emotion,
          of
          course,
          but when someone asks me to take their photo, I want to capture the real them. The natural, raw, beautiful
          smiles
          that God has given them. I want my client to feel comfortable throughout the whole process and love the final
          product at the end.
